Missile Command for Python
==========================
By Redflame1022

This is a (not the best but functional) clone of Missile Command for the Atari written in Python.
The idea was to use the turtle object for as much as I could. I am fairly new in Python soooooooo expect it to be hell to read through, however there is an INFO.md 
file that goes a bit into detail about each file. 

Make sure to install the font, which is in misc/fonts/
